## ECE 6123 â€“ IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING (SPRING 2023)

**Course Description**:  This course introduces fundamentals of image and video processing, including color image capture and representation; contrast enhancement; spatial domain filtering; two-dimensional (2D) Fourier transform and frequency domain interpretation of linear convolution; image sampling and resizing; multi-resolution image representation using pyramid and wavelet transforms; feature point detection and feature correspondence; geometric transformation, image registration, and image stitching;  video motion characterization and estimation; video stabilization and panoramic view generation; image representation using orthogonal transforms; sparsity-based image recovery; basic image compression techniques and standards (JPEG and JPEG2000 standard); video compression using adaptive spatial and temporal prediction; video coding standards (MPEGx/H26x); Stereo and multi- view image and video processing (depth from disparity, disparity estimation, video synthesis, compression). Basics of deep learning for image processing and computer vision will also be introduced.  Students will learn to implement selected algorithms in Python.   Prior experience with Python and deep learning are not required. You will learn as the course progresses. A class project, preferably in teams of 2 to 3 people,  is required.
